        <p>Q: What browser and wallet are you using?</p>
        <p>

        <p>Q: How do I verify using ledger?</p>
        <p>
          A: Send !verify as a DM to @GRAPE and follow the instructions to get
          your ledger verified.
        </p>
        <p>Q: Why donâ€™t I see channels after verifying?</p>
        <p>
          A: Check the correct wallet is verified , the token minimum or
          unlisted NFT are in your wallet. Then, check that you react to the
          emoji in the verification channel on the Discord server.
        </p>
        <p>Q: What access does Grape have to my wallet holdings?</p>
        <p>
          A: Grape takes security and privacy very seriously, your holdings are
          safe. Grape Access verifies you own control over your wallet by
          signing a message using your wallet locally on your computer. Your
          private key is never shared with Grape, since Grape compares your
          signature against your public key. You have the right to be
          immediately forgotten by unlinking your discord ID at any time.
        </p>
        <p>Q: How do I switch verified wallets?</p>
        <p>
          A: Unlink & disconnect the old verified wallet and verify the new
          wallet anew. Keep Discord open to avoid losing roles previously
          achieved. There are two methods to unlink -Send !unlink as a DM to
          @GRAPE and follow the instructions OR go to verify.grapes.network
          dashboard connecting to the old wallet(Supported for Sollet, Phantom
          and Solflare).
